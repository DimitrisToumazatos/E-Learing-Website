                                The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
                                Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.
                                The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express
                                a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
                                excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That‚Äôs why this chapter is called,
                                ‚ÄúThe way of the program‚Äù.
                                On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you
                                will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.

                            One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate
                            variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
                            2.1 Assignment statements
                            An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value:
                            >>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
                            >>> n = 17
                            >>> pi = 3.1415926535897932
                            This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named
                            message; the second gives the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of
                            œÄ to pi.
                            A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing
                            to its value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each
                            of the variables is in (think of it as the variable‚Äôs state of mind). Figure 2.1 shows the result
                            of the previous example.

                            In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs
                            a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of
                            statements. Later, you can ‚Äúcall‚Äù the function by name.

                            This chapter presents a case study that demonstrates a process for designing functions that
                            work together.
                            It introduces the turtle module, which allows you to create images using turtle graphics.
                            The turtle module is included in most Python installations, but if you are running Python
                            using PythonAnywhere, you won‚Äôt be able to run the turtle examples (at least you couldn‚Äôt
                            when I wrote this).
                            If you have already installed Python on your computer, you should be able to run the
                            examples. Otherwise, now is a good time to install. I have posted instructions at http:

                            The primary focus of this chapter is on the if statement, an essential programming structure that enables a
                            program to execute specific code blocks based on certain conditions or the program's current state. By using
                            if statements, you can create dynamic and responsive programs that behave differently depending on the values
                            of variables or inputs, providing greater flexibility and control. Before diving into the details of conditional
                            statements, however, this chapter will first introduce two foundational operators: floor division and modulus.
                            Floor division allows you to divide numbers while discarding any remainder, giving you only the whole number
                            result, which is useful in many programming scenarios where integer results are needed. The modulus operator,
                            on the other hand, returns the remainder of a division, which can be extremely helpful for tasks like
                            determining if a number is even or odd or performing cyclic operations. By understanding these operators, you‚Äôll
                            be well-prepared to write conditional statements that can handle a variety of real-world problems effectively.

                            Many of the Python functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce return
                            values. But the functions we‚Äôve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a
                            value or moving a turtle, but they don‚Äôt have a return value. In this chapter you will learn
                            to write fruitful functions.

                            This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements repeatedly.
                            We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in Section 5.8. We saw another kind, using a
                            for loop, in Section 4.2. In this chapter we‚Äôll see yet another kind, using a while statement.
                            But first I want to say a little more about variable assignment.

                            This chapter presents the second case study, which involves solving word puzzles by
                            searching for words that have certain properties. For example, we‚Äôll find the longest palindromes in English and search for words whose letters appear in alphabetical order. And
                            I will present another program development plan: reduction to a previously solved problem.

                            This chapter introduces one of the most powerful and frequently used built-in types in Python: lists. Lists are
                            essential tools in Python because they allow you to store collections of items, whether they are numbers, strings,
                            or even other lists. You‚Äôll discover how versatile lists can be, enabling you to group data in an organized way,
                            access elements by their position, and modify the contents as needed. In addition to lists, you will also delve
                            deeper into the concept of objects in Python. This exploration includes understanding how objects hold data and
                            how Python uses references to manage them. An object can have multiple names, or variables, that refer to it,
                            which can lead to changes that affect all references to the object. By studying lists and object behavior,
                            you‚Äôll gain insights into how Python handles data, memory, and the ways different variables can point to the
                            same object, impacting program logic in subtle but important ways.
