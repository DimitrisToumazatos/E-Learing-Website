            <p>If you want to learn how to program, working with Python is an excellent way to start.
            This hands-on guide takes you through the language a step at a time, beginning with basic programming concepts before moving on to functions, recursion, data structures, and object-oriented design. This second edition and its supporting code have been updated for Python 3.

            Explore interface design, data structures, and GUI-based programs through case studies</p>
            <p>Through exercises in each chapter, you'll try out programming concepts as you learn them. Think Python is ideal for students at the high school or college level, as well as self-learners, home-schooled students, and professionals who need to learn programming basics. Beginners just getting their feet wet will learn how to start with Python in a browser.</p>

            <ul><li>Start with the basics, including language syntax and semantics</li>
                <li>Get a clear definition of each programming concept</li>
                <li>Learn about values, variables, statements, functions, and data structures in a logical progression</li>
                <li>Discover how to work with files and databases</li>
                <li>Understand objects, methods, and object-oriented programming</li>
                <li> Use debugging techniques to fix syntax, runtime, and semantic errors</li></ul>

                        The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
                        Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.
                        The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express
                        a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
                        excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That‚Äôs why this chapter is called,
                        ‚ÄúThe way of the program‚Äù.
                        On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you
                        will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.

                    <p>
                        One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate
                        variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
                        2.1 Assignment statements
                        An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value:
                        >>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
                        >>> n = 17
                        >>> pi = 3.1415926535897932
                        This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named
                        message; the second gives the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of
                        œÄ to pi.
                        A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing
                        to its value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each
                        of the variables is in (think of it as the variable‚Äôs state of mind). Figure 2.1 shows the result
                        of the previous example.

                        In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs
                        a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of
                        statements. Later, you can ‚Äúcall‚Äù the function by name.

                        This chapter presents a case study that demonstrates a process for designing functions that
                        work together.
                        It introduces the turtle module, which allows you to create images using turtle graphics.
                        The turtle module is included in most Python installations, but if you are running Python
                        using PythonAnywhere, you won‚Äôt be able to run the turtle examples (at least you couldn‚Äôt
                        when I wrote this).
                        If you have already installed Python on your computer, you should be able to run the
                        examples. Otherwise, now is a good time to install. I have posted instructions at http:

                        The main topic of this chapter is the if statement, which executes different code depending
                        on the state of the program. But first I want to introduce two new operators: floor division
                        and modulus.

                        Many of the Python functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce return
                        values. But the functions we‚Äôve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a
                        value or moving a turtle, but they don‚Äôt have a return value. In this chapter you will learn
                        to write fruitful functions.

                        This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements repeatedly.
                        We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in Section 5.8. We saw another kind, using a
                        for loop, in Section 4.2. In this chapter we‚Äôll see yet another kind, using a while statement.
                        But first I want to say a little more about variable assignment.

                        Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. A string is a sequence, which means it is
                        an ordered collection of other values. In this chapter you‚Äôll see how to access the characters
                        that make up a string, and you‚Äôll learn about some of the methods strings provide.

                        This chapter presents the second case study, which involves solving word puzzles by
                        searching for words that have certain properties. For example, we‚Äôll find the longest palindromes in English and search for words whose letters appear in alphabetical order. And
                        I will present another program development plan: reduction to a previously solved problem.
